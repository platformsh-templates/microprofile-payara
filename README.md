# Payara Micro Maven for Platform.sh

This project provides a starter kit for Payara Micro projects hosted on Platform.sh.  It includes a minimalist application skeleton that is intended for you to use as a starting point and modify for your own needs, along with the Platform.sh Config Reader to simplify accessing Platform.sh environment variables.

Payara Micro is an Open Source, lightweight Java EE (Jakarta EE) microservices deployments.

## Features

* Java 11
* Automatic TLS certificates
* Maven-based build

## Customizations

The following files and additions make the framework work.  If using this project as a reference for your own existing project, replicate the changes below to your project.

* [`.platform/routes.yaml`](.platform/routes.yaml): Platform.sh allows you to define the [routes](https://docs.platform.sh/configuration/routes.html).
* [`.platform/services.yaml`](.platform/services.yaml):  Platform.sh allows you to completely define and configure the topology and [services you want to use on your project](https://docs.platform.sh/configuration/services.html).
* [`.platform.app.yaml`](.platform.app.yaml): You control your application and the way it will be built and deployed on Platform.sh [via a single configuration file](https://docs.platform.sh/configuration/app-containers.html).
* An additional library dependency, [`platformsh/config-reader-java`](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-java), has been added.  It provides convenience wrappers for accessing the Platform.sh environment variables.
